<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

  <ol><p>HTML is cool</p>
<p>CSS is cooler</p>
<p>JS is the best</p></ol>

<h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>

<p>
<ul>Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files</ul>
</p>
